<text id="190">A shard of the shattered Elden Ring.
Grants the blessing of an equipped Great Rune upon use.

Even if no Great Rune is equipped, it will slightly increase maximum HP upon use.

The lower arc of the Elden Ring is held to be the basin in which its blessings pool. Perhaps this shard originates from that very arc.</text>
<text id="191">A Great Rune of the shardbearer Godrick.
Its blessing raises all attributes.

This Great Rune is known as the anchor ring, found in the center of the Elden Ring.

The first demigods were The Elden Lord Godfrey and his offspring, the golden lineage.</text>
<text id="192">A Great Rune of the shardbearer Radahn.
Its blessing raises maximum HP, FP and Stamina.

Radahn was amongst the children of Rennala and Radagon, who became demigod stepchildren after Radagon's union with Queen Marika.

The Great Rune burns, to resist the encroachment of the scarlet rot.</text>
<text id="193">A Great Rune of the shardbearer Morgott.
Its blessing greatly raises maximum HP.

This Great Rune is the anchor ring that houses the base, and proves two things:

That the Omen King was born of the golden lineage, and that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell.</text>
<text id="194">A Great Rune of the shardbearer Rykard.
Its blessing restores HP upon defeating enemies.

Rykard was amongst the children of Rennala and Radagon, who became demigod stepchildren after Radagon's union with Queen Marika.

But Rykard fed himself to the blasphemous serpent, Great Rune and all.</text>
<text id="195">A Great Rune of the shardbearer Mohg.
Its blessing grants a blessing of blood to summoned phantoms, and imparts a Phantom Great Rune upon successful invasion.

Mohg and Morgott are twin brothers, and their Great Runes are naturally similar.

But Mohg's rune is soaked in accursed blood, from his devout love for the wretched mire that he was born into far below the earth.</text>
<text id="196">A Great Rune of the shardbearer Malenia.
The blessing of this half-rotted rune reduces the healing power of Flask of Crimson Tears.

And yet, due to the infusion of Malenia's spirit of resistance, attacks made immediately after receiving damage will partially recover HP.

Malenia is daughter to Queen Marika and Radagon, and her Great Rune should have been the most sacred of all.</text>
